  abstract = {The coronavirus spike protein is a multifunctional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells. It first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its S1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its S2 subunit. Two domains in S1 from different coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, leading to viral attachment. The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion. The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion. This article reviews current knowledge about the structures and functions of coronavirus spike proteins, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions. I further discuss the evolution of these two critical functions of coronavirus spike proteins, receptor recognition and membrane fusion, in the context of the corresponding functions from other viruses and host cells.},

  abstract = {The goal of pandemic response is to provide the greatest protection, for the most people, in the least amount of time. Short response times minimize both current and future health impacts for evolving pathogens that pose global threats. To achieve this goal, efficient and effective systems are needed for distributing and administering vaccines, a cornerstone of pandemic response. COVID-19 vaccines were developed in record time in the U.S. and abroad, but U.S. data shows that they were not distributed efficiently and effectively once available. In an effort to “put vaccines on every corner”, pharmacies and other small venues were a primary means for vaccinating individuals, but daily throughput rates at these locations were very low. This contributed to extended times from manufacture to administration. An important contributing factor to slow administration rates for COVID-19 was vaccine transport and storage box size. In this paper, we establish a general system objective and provide a computationally tractable approach for allocating vaccines in a rolling horizon manner optimally. We illustrate the consequences of both box size and the number and capacity of dispensing locations on achieving system objectives. Using U.S. CDC data, we demonstrate that if vaccines are allocated and distributed according to our proposed strategy, more people would have been vaccinated sooner in the U.S. Many additional days of protection would have occurred, meaning there would have been fewer infections, less demand for healthcare resources, lower overall mortality, and fewer opportunities for the evolution of vaccine-evading strains of the disease.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 led to a record-breaking race to develop a vaccine. However, the limited vaccine capacity creates another massive challenge: how to distribute vaccines to mitigate the near-end impact of the pandemic? In the United States in particular, the new Biden administration is launching mass vaccination sites across the country, raising the obvious question of where to locate these clinics to maximize the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign. This paper tackles this question with a novel data-driven approach to optimize COVID-19 vaccine distribution. We first augment a state-of-the-art epidemiological model, called DELPHI, to capture the effects of vaccinations and the variability in mortality rates across age groups. We then integrate this predictive model into a prescriptive model to optimize the location of vaccination sites and subsequent vaccine allocation. The model is formulated as a bilinear, nonconvex optimization model. To solve it, we propose a coordinate descent algorithm that iterates between optimizing vaccine distribution and simulating the dynamics of the pandemic. As compared to benchmarks based on demographic and epidemiological information, the proposed optimization approach increases the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign by an estimated 20\%, saving an extra 4000 extra lives in the United States over a 3-month period. The proposed solution achieves critical fairness objectives—by reducing the death toll of the pandemic in several states without hurting others—and is highly robust to uncertainties and forecast errors—by achieving similar benefits under a vast range of perturbations.},

This study re-examined the data to see if these findings hold after controlling for alternative explanations. The dependent variable in the study was COVID-19 vaccination rates in 3,109 counties in the United States~as of April 2022. The study examined 36 possible alternative explanations for vaccine hesitancy, including~demographic, social, economic, environmental, and medical variables known to affect vaccine hesitancy. County-level political affiliation was measured as a percent of voters in the county who were affiliated with Democratic or Republican political parties. Data were analyzed using a temporally constrained multiple mediation network, which allowed for the identification of both direct~and indirect predictors~of vaccination rates. Despite controlling for alternative explanations of hesitancy, there was a statistically significant relationship between the percentage of Republican supporters and rates of vaccine hesitancy. The higher the Republican affiliation, the lower the vaccination rates. It is possible that the Republican Party has played an organizing role in encouraging vaccine hesitancy and patient harm.},
